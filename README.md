# Instructions on the basics of how to use this git hub repository:
  ## Downloading this repository
  - Type in the git bash terminal after choosing your current directory: Git clone <repository http>
  OR
  - just download the zip and unpack it
  
  - Main branch: where we will push out the game and our finalized changes. Dont touch branch this unless your work has been finalized. 
  - Your branch: where you will/can be making changes separate to the main branch
  ## Putting changes into branches:
   ### If you are using Github Desktop App:
    - click the fetch button above 
    - commit your changes with the boxes below on the bottom left
    - write a commit topic and description of what you did. (And make it clear. This is for the reason that when you want to come back and know what you did, you can).
    - click push
   ### If you are using Github Bash:
    These are the commands you will/can use:
       - git branch
       - git checkout <your branch name>
       - (a git fetch command for your branch. I dont know this very well)
       - cd your <Unity folder path> (for example: cd Desktop/CS108-FinalGameProject/CS108FinalGameProject
       - git status (to see what files are being tracked)
       - git add . (for adding all the changes you are tracking) 
       or
       - git add <what ever file you want> (for adding the specific changes you want)
       - git push
       - put in user name from github. put in authenication token.
## Working in Unity:
   - you have your own scene to work in. it's basically your work space. play around with animations, make levels, write scripts, do what you want in your scene. all the assets will/should be separated into folders though for organization.
   - we will pour our work into different scenes/levels when things get going.
